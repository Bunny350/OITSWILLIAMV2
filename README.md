This branch contains the upcoming version of Exhaust Lite.

## Exhaust Lite Generation 2 Features
**Bigger filtration path.** This will improve the filtration efficiency.
  
**Better fan.** This design uses 4010 fan that was found in Voron Afterburner / Stealthburner as a hotend cooling fan.
  
*Cleaner design.* Since ELG2 is bigger than the first gen EL, there is only one wiring guide exposed, instead of two.

This branch will be released once it's manual uploaded and finalized.
